# Digital Business Engineering Information Python-Chatbot

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Digital Business Engineering (DBE) Information Chatbot. This Python-based chatbot leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GPT-4 to provide information about the Master's program in Digital Business Engineering. It extracts and processes data from PDFs and interacts with users, answering their queries about the study program.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF documents related to the DBE program.
- **Tokenization and Text Splitting**: Utilizes GPT-2 tokenizer to process and split text data.
- **Embedding Generation**: Creates embeddings for text chunks for efficient information retrieval.
- **Question-Answering System**: Leverages a QA retrieval system powered by GPT-4 to answer student queries.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Built with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for querying and displaying responses.
