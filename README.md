# Python-Chatbot

This chatbot answers questions from students and prospective students about the Master's degree program in Digital Business Engineering (DBE).
The chatbot was fed and trained with data and information about the Master's program DBE in the form of a PDF file. 
An OpenAI API was used as embedding and LangChain as LLM. 
The streamlit library was used to display and program the interface in the chatbot's browser.
