# Python-Chatbot

### This chatbot answers questions from students and prospective students about the Master's degree program in Digital Business Engineering (DBE).

### The chatbot was fed and trained with data and information about the Master's program DBE in the form of a PDF file. 

### We used the OpenAI API as embedding and also as LLM. LangChain was also used. 
### In different branches, we work with different tokenizers like the GPT tokonizer from OpenAI and the Llama tokenizer, to see how they compare. 

### The streamlit library was used to program the interface of the chatbot and to display it in the browser.
